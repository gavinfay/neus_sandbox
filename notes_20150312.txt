Developing common scenarios for the Atlantis Summit

Climate: Discussion over challenging nature of different models having varying capabilities of being able to implement changes
 - e.g. hi-res hyrdo, or fixed Temp forcing, etc.


1. Cross-Sector Multiple Use Management
2. Climate
	- Forcing with Temp over time - proportional change -climate prediction for your system
	- changes in hydrodynamic pattern associated with climate change (more challenging but more realistic), only a subset of models can do this.
3. Fisheries 
	

DRIVERS
	Climate
	AreaUse Conflict
	Overfishing
	Conservation (MPAs)

	Future Scenarios, compare EBM vs Business as Usual
	EBM makes most sense 



Fishing
	1. Status Quo - project current F or E forward
	2. All species at SS FMSY
	3. Fixed F, egg. quotas, floors
	4. COnstant catch
	5. Gear Ban
	6. Balanced Fishing
	7. Multispecies FMSY
	8. general advice on objectives - how do inividual models figure out how to implement.
    9. 

    Focus on contrasts, how are you going to implement, what do you have to change.

    fishing at lower trophic levels

    consumption driven limits

    multiple use management: % decreases in fishing, or area closures, gear-specific effects.
    
    Ban fishing from conservation areas.

    Area use conflict between different energy uses
   
    


BUsiness as usual
Single Species (Fishing focus), ss FMSY, no closyres
Extreme Conservation (Bans / closures / low quitas) , forage fish control rules
EBM (Balance)
	a. spatial closures for other human uses
	   ecosystem fishing scenario
    b. MPAs smaller than 3
